| syfpeithi 1.0 | **position-specific scoring matrices**; the matrices are manually generated based on expert knowledge and the occurrence of amino acids in naturally processed MHC ligands from the SYFPEITHI database |[Rammensee, et al., 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10602881)  |T-cell epitope | 
|tepitopepan 1.0 |  First, each HLA-DR binding pocket is represented by amino acid residues that have close contact with the corresponding peptide binding core residues. Then the pocket similarity between two HLA-DR molecules is calculated as the sequence similarity of the residues. Finally, for an uncharacterized HLA-DR molecule, the binding specificity of each pocket is computed as a weighted average in **pocket binding specificities** over HLA-DR molecules characterized by TEPITOPE.| [(Zhang, et al., 2012)](dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030483) | MHC-II binding |
